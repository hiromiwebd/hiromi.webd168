            <p class="reason-title"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;REASON FOR APPLYING</strong></p>
            <p class="rs">I was impressed by your company's service as a bridge between companies in the US and mainly
                Japanese people who are
                looking for a job, and I applied for this job because I would like to be involved. I was
                considering finding
                a job in Japan because I thought that it would be better to work in an environment where I could work in
                my mother
                language in order to build a career in a new industry.
                However, there were no jobs in the web industry available for someone over 30 years old with no
                experience, so I
                decided to look for
                a job in the US. In Japan, companies focus on age and educational background, but I felt that the US can
                let people
                challenge at any age regardless of our academic background after I have seen classmates from a wide age
                range. I was
                searching for jobs in English, but I was hesitant to apply because it was my first time working in the
                US. Your company
                primarily targets Japanese and provides a safe environment for job seekers to find and change jobs.
                Therefore, I would
                like to support job seekers through my skills including web development.</p>

            <p class="self-promo-title"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;SELF-PROMOTION</strong></p>
            <p class="pr">Because I had no family to rely on in the US, my husband and I have been working together to
                take
                care of our
                child to
                balance work, study and home. Because of that, I am confident that I will be able to perform well during
                an internship. I
                have acquired skills above by working as a nurse because they have many people's lives in their hands,
                they take care of
                patients as a team, and they need to be actively involved with patients. I also currently work remote,
                so I work with
                others with my skills, especially communication ones. I would like to acquire new knowledge and
                build on my skills by
                working on your internship.
