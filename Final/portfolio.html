                <p>I am from Japan. I graduated a nursing university there, and I had worked for 7
                    years as a registered nurse. I gave birth my daughter in 2020, so I quit my job. Actually, that
                    was
                    a good opportunity because working as a nurse in Japan is really tough for me and I wanted to
                    have a
                    reason to quit. In Japan, quitting a job is so hard. Since I met my husband, I started to be
                    interested in web development and study html and css on my own.</p>

                <p>I moved to the U.S a year and half ago and started to go to Miramar College to take
                    ELAC classes. I am taking ELAC 145 at Mesa College right now and this is my last English class.
                    I
                    started to take classes for web development since summer semester 2023, and I has been learning
                    html, css, and php. Taking html and css class is the second time and my skill has improved so
                    much
                    than I expected. I study with textbooks which are written in my language to deepen my
                    understanding.

                <p>I have registered classes for next semester recently. If I pass them, I can have certificate of
                    achievement. After that, I am going to take rest of classes to have associate science. If things
                    go
                    well, I will look for a job as an internship learn more. My husband is a software engineer, so
                    he will help me to get a job in the U.S because I have never worked in this country. I can't
                    wait to
                    work here as a frontend engineer because it is my dream and I can show my friends in my country
                    that
                    we can do my best no matter what age we are.
