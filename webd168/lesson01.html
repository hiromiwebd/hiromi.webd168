                    <h3>Profile</h3>
                    <p>Hello! I am Hiromi Rodriguez and from Japan. I have my husband and my daughter, and we have two
                        dogs.
                        The
                        one came to
                        the US with us from Japan and the other joined my family a month ago. We bought a house in Mira
                        Mesa
                        last
                        year and we
                        love our neighborhood!
                    </p>

                    <h3>My experience</h3>
                    <p>I have been taking classes for my major since summer semester 2023. I took "WEBD 152" and "MULTI
                        100",
                        and now I am
                        taking"WEBD 167" which is about PHP and database. I studied begginer html and css with textbooks
                        in
                        my
                        langage when I
                        was in Japan on my own.
                    </p>

                    <h3>About WEBD 168</h3>

                    <p>I chose this class because I learned beginner html and css last semester. I would like to learn
                        more
                        and make my skills
                        better. I will also refer textbooks written in my language while taking this classes to deepen
                        my
                        understanding. I hope
                        my skills get better and I have more confidence to make a website.
