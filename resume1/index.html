            <p class="pr">Because I had no family to rely on in the US, my husband and I have been working together to
                take
                care of our
                child to
                balance work, study and home. Because of that, I am confident that I will be able to perform well during
                training. I
                have acquired skills above by working as a nurse because they have many people's lives in their hands,
                they take care of
                patients as a team, and they need to be actively involved with patients. I also currently work remote,
                so I work with
                others with my skills, especially communication ones. I would like to acquire new knowledge and
                build on my skills by
                working on your training programs.
